# HTTP Transformation
OpenEndpoints can easily interact with third party REST or SOAP APIs, either using such API as a data-source, or to execute a TASK.
The request body of such request can be **either inline content** (=directly written into endpoints.xml or into the data-source  definition), **or** the body is **generated by XSLT transformation**.
The source of transformation (=the XML generated by the software to which the XSLT is applied) has always the same schema (= `http-transformation-input.xsd` in this directory), but the values of the parameters inside that generated xml are different depending on the context:

## Parameter Transformation
The parameter transformation tag can contain any data sources, including data from an HTTP request. But at this point the "final" parameter values have not yet been generated! Therefore, **in this case only**, the input xml contains the parameters from the original request. Note that the original request could have different parameters than those declared in the endpoints.xml - which is possible when parameter transformation is used.

## Data-Sources and Tasks
HTTP requests that are part of a regular data-source definition or a task have the same parameters and parameter values in the input xml for generating a request body that are declared in endpoints.xml and whose values can be different after a parameter transformation than in the original request.
