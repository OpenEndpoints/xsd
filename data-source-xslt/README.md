# Data-Source XSLT

The  **optional**  directory  `data-source-xslt` contains custom xslt files.

Each transformer references to a data-source, which can be transformed to any output having some custom data-source-xslt file.

See:  [Data Source Transformation](https://app.developerhub.io/documentation/v1.0/configuration/data-source-transformation)

## Transformation Input

The data-source will generate a file with a root tag  `<transformation-input>` comprising of all content generated by the data-sources.
