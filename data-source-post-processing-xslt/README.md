# Data-Source Post Processing

## Extension of the data source definition
A data source definition consists of one or more data sources that are loaded into the software's temporary memory when this data source is called. The standard behavior is that each data source is converted to XML when it is loaded (if not already XML anyway) and is then available for the data source transformation in precisely this state (after the auto conversion).

With the data-source post processing you can optionally change the content and structure of the data source after this import before it is made accessible for the data-source transformation.

This can be helpful, for example, to optimize a data source for use in an XSLT template, or also to standardize different data sources as a result of post-processing - and thus, for example, to increase the reusability of data source templates.

## Transformation Input and Output
The only requirement for the XSLT is that
 - the root tag of the input xml (which is automatically provided by the
   software) is `<data-source-post-processing-input>`
 - the root tag of the output (=the file that is generated by your XSLT)
   must be `<data-source-post-processing-output>`

## Multi-Step Processing
It is possible to have any number of transformations carried out one after the other. A separate XSLT is used for each.
What remains unchanged, however, is that for each individual step the generated input XML is given the root tag `<data-source-post-processing-input>` by the software, and that each individual XSLT must generate an XML with the root tag `<data-source-post-processing-output>`.

## Applicable to both the individual data sources and the combined data source
Single or multi-level post-processing can be applied to each individual data source (i.e. within the root tag of the individual data source) as well as to the combined data of all individual data sources.
