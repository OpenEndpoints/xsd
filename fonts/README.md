# Custom Fonts
You can **embed** any TTF fonts into your generated PDF.
Upload the TTF fonts into this directory and declare it in apache-fop-config.xsd.
Note that the file-name of the ttf font may be different from the name as used in the font-triplet attribute. The font-name as refered to in the XSLT must be the same as in the font-triplet name attribute (case sensitive).
